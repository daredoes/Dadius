Dadius is a game developed by Matt Bryant, Arthur Baney, Daniel Evans, Tamara Chang, and Emily Douglas.

It was made in 2014 as an entry into the SJSU Game Development Club Semester Game Challenge.

The game was shown off at Maker Faire in 2014, but the game has a serious flaw that makes it extremely easy to score points in.

Development will not continue.
